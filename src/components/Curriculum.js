                        CIA FIRST International School â€™s curriculum is unique and innovative. Piece by piece, the academic team has created a curricular 
                        program that focuses on global competencies and 21st-century skills. By using the Understanding by Design Framework (UbD), and 
                        integrating the Habits of Mind (HoMs), CIA FIRST student develops long-term and transferable understandings, which they can apply 
                        to real situations and solve real-world problems (Schoolwide Learner Outcomes).
